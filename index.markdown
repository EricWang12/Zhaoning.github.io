# <span style="color:#A31F34"><b>Research Interest</b></span>

I am interested in using state-of-the-art deep learning and computer vision to improve machine perceptions and let them aware of their surroundings. 

I am particularly interested in **3D reconstructions**, **Generative Networks** and **human-related computer vision**. I am also keen on **data-driven computer vision** or **synthetic data**. I believe these will fundamentally help to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical world, i.e. Computers and Reality.



I'm always open to research collaborations in this area. Feel free to drop me an email at :
