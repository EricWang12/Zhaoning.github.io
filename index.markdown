# <span style="color:#A31F34"><b>Research Interest</b></span>

I am interested in using state-of-the-art deep learning and computer vision to improve machine perceptions and let them aware of their surroundings. 

I am particularly interested in **3D reconstructions**, **Scene Understanding** and **human-related computer vision**. I am also keen on **data-driven computer vision** or **synthetic data**. I believe these will help boost the technology of Augmented Reality, robotics and self-driving algorithms.



I'm always open to research collaborations in this area. Feel free to drop me an email at :
