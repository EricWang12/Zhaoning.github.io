# <span style="color:#A31F34"><b>About me</b></span>
I am Zhaoning Wang, a research Master's student at the Center of Research in Computer Vision ([CRCV](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/)) of University of Central Florida (UCF). I am advised by Prof. [Chen Chen](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/chenchen/). Before that, I was a visiting research scholar at Human Sensing Lab at Robotic Institute (RI) at CMU, where I am fortunate to work with prof.[Fernando De la Torre](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/). I obtained the Bachelor's degree of Computer Science and Computer Engineering at Unviersity of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Prof. [Yixuan Sharon Li](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/).


# <span style="color:#A31F34"><b>Research Interest</b></span>

I am interested in using state-of-the-art deep learning and computer vision to improve machine perceptions and let them aware of their surroundings. 

I am particularly interested in **3D Nerual Representations**, **3D reconstructions**, **Generative Networks** and **human-related computer vision**. I am also keen on **data-driven computer vision** or **synthetic data**. I believe these will fundamentally help to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical world, i.e. Computers and Reality.



I'm always open to research collaborations in this area. Feel free to drop me an email at :
