# Five Minutes Version

### **step 0: get a github account if you don't have one**
get one here [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

### **step 1: create a repo with name you'd like to be the appendix of your website**

Note that your website will be *your_username*.github.io/*repository_name* (EricWang12.github.io/Home in this example)

*also for repository name, cases DO matter*

Take Home as example:
![](/assets/images/Dummy%20Website%20Building%20Tutorial/5-home.jpg)

hit Create repository

### **step 2: initiate your pages**

go to Setting 
![](/assets/images/Dummy%20Website%20Building%20Tutorial/5-setting.jpg)

find the part of **GitHub Pages**

![](/assets/images/Dummy%20Website%20Building%20Tutorial/5-github-pages.jpg)

click choose a theme and find the best theme you'd like and click **select theme**

Take Slate theme as a example:

![](/assets/images/Dummy%20Website%20Building%20Tutorial/5-theme.jpg)

Then it will go to a file called **index.md**, That will be your website page!


![](/assets/images/Dummy%20Website%20Building%20Tutorial/5-index-md.jpg)

After you finish editing it, or just leave it and edit later, click **commit changes** at the bottom.
You can always change it later!


### **step 3: see and edit your website**

Your website is already live! take a look at *your_username*.github.io/*repository_name* (EricWang12.github.io/Home in this case)


If you want to edit your web,

find the **index.md** in the repository
![](/assets/images/Dummy%20Website%20Building%20Tutorial/5-repo.jpg)

click the file and click the little pen mark on top right 
![](/assets/images/Dummy%20Website%20Building%20Tutorial/5-edit.jpg)

and you are back to editing!

The index.md IS the information on your website, you can find a cheatsheet of markdown from adam-p [HERE](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### **step 4: There is no step 4! U R Done!**

Or you can read the cheatsheet above...

### **Get a domain**

I used [Google domains](https://domains.google.com/) to get the my domain, as the interface is cleaner and it has better Search Engine Optimization. The tutorial would be based on Google domains, but You can use any domain register website you want.

You go and search the url you want

If it is not occupied, then awesome!! buy that and you will have your own domain name!!!


### **Set up local environment for Jekyll**

First install all stuff you need from the "Installation" from [Jekyll page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
