## Get a domain

I used [Google domains](https://domains.google.com/) to get the my domain, as the interface is cleaner and it has better Search Engine Optimization. The tutorial would be based on Google domains, but You can use any domain register website you want.

You go and search the url you want

## Set up local environment for Jekyll

First install all stuff you need from the "Installation" from [Jekyll page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
